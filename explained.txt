step 1:   consider 3*3 window.if the current pixel nim(m,n) <255 && >0
           do nothing

step 2:   else find the number of noisefree elents in that 3*3 window (mm) .if this is greater than window size( i.e 3)
           then replace the noise pixel by median of the noise free pixels

step 3:  else  increase window size by 2 upto maxwindow size (wsmax) (ie 13). after increasing window size by 2 (ie now 5)
          check for the number of noise free pixels . if it is >=  window size(ie now 5) replace the center pixel with median of that window noise free pixels
          if not then increment again by 2 and check for that condition again . until window size = maximum window size (13)

step 4:  else if maximum window is reached by incrementing and still didnt work then again find the number of noise free pixels (mm) and if it is less than window size
         replace cnter pixel with mean of noise free pixe;s of that window
         else if that condition is also not satisfied then check if the entire wiindow contains only 0s and 255s , if yes then replace the center pixel by mean of that window elements
          else if all these conditions fail, then replace the cnter puxel by median of all the elements int the window(not only the  noise free but all the elemets)
end
